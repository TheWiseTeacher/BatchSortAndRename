# BatchSortAndRename
**A _simple_ batch renaming tool.**\
\
This tool helps you sort your files by (**Date modified, Date created, Size, Type, File name**) and then rename them.\
\
The naming pattern is simple for now, you select a starting number, a padding for this number, a before/after number text, and finally you can unify the files extension. The tool also provides a way to **track these changes** by choosing to log these changes. **Note** that these logs start wth "_bsnr_" and thus are ignored by the tool when loading directory files!

## Usage
To use the program you need to :
  1. Select the folder where your files are located
  2. Choose if you want to **log the changes**
  3. Select the sorting options
  4. Configure your naming pattern
  5. Click **Process** to rename your batch of files
